# pandas-challenge

# This project is an assignment by Andrew Belfiglio in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

# This repository contains the PyCitySchools challenge. PyCitySchools contains standardized assessment scores from 39,170 students across 15 schools in the district. The school and its characteristics (e.g., size, type, budget) are reported for each student. By aggregating student scores and subsquently assessing trends by school,  type (i.e., District or Charter), size, and budget, we find the characteristics associated with top- and bottom-performing schools.

# The main analysis and code can be found in the PyCitySchools.ipynb file. The original raw data contains two csv files in the Resources subfolder.

# This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program.
